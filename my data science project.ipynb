    "Background: McCurr Consultancy is an MNC that has thousands of employees spread across the globe. The company believes in hiring the best talent available and retaining them for as long as possible. A huge amount of resources is spent on retaining existing employees through various initiatives. The Head of People Operations wants to bring down the cost of retaining employees. For this, he proposes limiting the incentives to only those employees who are at risk of attrition. As a recently hired Data Scientist in the People Operations Department, you have been asked to identify patterns in characteristics of employees who leave the organization. Also, you have to use this information to predict if an employee is at risk of attrition. This information will be used to target them with incentives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To predict if an employee is going to attrite or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Questions:\n",
    "1. Which are the different factors that drive attrition?\n",
    "2. What factors have no effect on attrition?\n",
    "3. What is the accuracy of the prediction using the model?\n",
    "4. Which algorithm gives the best accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Guideline:\n",
    "##1. Visualize some of the variables individually to better understand the variables at your disposal\n",
    "i was able to visualize the relationship of the variables of age and total working years, monthly income and total working years,\n",
    "job level and total monthly income, year in company and year since promotion to know the value of how the incentive will be pass among the staff \n",
    "##2. Visualize pairs of variables to better understand the correlation between the features and the target variables\n",
    "iwas able to use Attrition as my features and target to evaluate and to build my model into three types: which is training, validation and testing set. \n",
    "    \n",
    "##3. Divide the data into Training and Testing datasets (70:30) and build predictive models using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms.\n",
    "i used the minmaxscaler to fit and transform my model. and then make my dataset 70:30. at this time i use my logistic regression and my output\n",
    "    for training set is 0.8584 and on validation is 0.8551. then on random forest my training set is 0.9885 and validation is 0.9040.\n",
    "    o regularize by using hyperparameters then my training set is 0.8578 and validation is 0.8551. \n",
    "##5. Compare the models using Model Performance Measures and comment on the findings\n",
    "i use =d model performance measures by using the confusion matrix and recall score. this is the result i have\n",
    "confusion matrix:     \n",
    "[[604   6]\n",
    " [108  17]]\n",
